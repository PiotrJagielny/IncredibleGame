This is a platformer game, where i implemented a bunch of intresting mechanics.

I made it with only C++ and SFML graphics library.

On game start the main screen pops up

There are 3 main levels, with boss between each level
On first level you have to kill monsters. If enough monsters are killed you can go to next level

Between levels there is boss. That is a big bat that is spawning smaller bats and every few secounds big bat attacks with big shock wave on visible for bat area as there is shown below
